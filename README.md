Test project to get familiar with user authentication
=====

## User stories :
* I can register with a new username and password
* If the username is already in the database, I will be told so
* Once registered, I have access to a profile page greeting me
* I can access the profile page only when logged
* I can logout once on the profile page

The front end will be simple as this project is focused on back end functionalities.
